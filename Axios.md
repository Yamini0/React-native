# What is Axios?

Promise-based HTTP client for the browser.It provides a single API for dealing with XMLHttpRequests. Besides that, it wraps the requests using a polyfill for ES6 new promise syntax.

## what axios can do:

- Make XMLHttpRequests from the browser
- Make http requests from node.js
- Supports the Promise API
- Intercept request and response
- Transform request and response data
- Cancel requests
- Automatic transforms for JSON data
- Client side support for protecting against XSRF

## Installing:

1. Using nmp:

`npm install axios`

2. Using yarn:

`yarn add axios`

## How to use Axios with React-native:

1. Install axios and import in the project.

`import axios from 'axios';`

2. Make a `GET` request. You use `axios.get(url)` with a URL from an API endpoint to get a promise which returns a response object.

```
axios.get(`https:/baseUrl.com/users`)
      .then(res => {
        const persons = res.data;
        this.setState({ persons });
      })
  }
```

3. Make a `POST` Request. Using POST gives you the same response object with information that you can use inside of a then call.

To complete the POST request, you first capture the user input. Then you add the input along with the POST request, which will give you a response. You can then console.log the response, which should show the user input in the form.

```
axios.post(`https://baseURL.com/users`, { user })
      .then(res => {
        console.log(result);
        console.log(result.data);
      })
```

## Use of `async` and `await`

you can use async and await to work with promises.

The await keyword resolves the promise and returns the value. The value can then be assigned to a variable. For Example:

```
handleSubmit = async event => {
  event.preventDefault();

  //
  const response = await API.delete(`users/${this.state.id}`);

  console.log(response);
  console.log(response.data);
};
```

## Base Instance in Axios

It is a good practise to set up a base instance in which we can define a URl and other configuration elements. For Example:

```
import axios from 'axios';

export default axios.create({
  baseURL: `http://itunes.com/`
});
```
